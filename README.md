# SQL for Data Engineering: Interview Preparation

### ## About This Repository

This repository is a log of my daily SQL practice as I prepare for technical interviews for Data Engineering and Data Analytics roles. It contains my solutions to challenges from platforms like LeetCode and StrataScratch, with an emphasis on writing clean, efficient, and optimal queries.

### ## My Goals

* **Build confidence** and fluency in advanced SQL concepts.
* **Master patterns** frequently tested in data-focused technical screens.
* **Develop a habit** of consistent, daily problem-solving.

---

### ## Key Concepts Covered

My practice is focused on the skills most relevant to data engineering workflows:

* **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`)
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for readability and complex logic
* **Advanced `JOIN`s** (Self-Joins, multi-table joins)
* **Complex Aggregations** (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* **Subqueries** (Scalar, Multi-row, Correlated)
* **Data Manipulation and Transformation**

This repository is a living document of my journey to sharpen the foundational skills required for a successful career in data.
